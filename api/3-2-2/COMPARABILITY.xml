			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from nationally representative data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems. The UN IGME does not use any covariates to derive its estimates. It only applies a curve fitting method to good-quality empirical data to derive trend estimates after data quality assessment. Whereas the country use a direct method is used based on a full birth history, a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
