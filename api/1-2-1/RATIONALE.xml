			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Monitoring national poverty is important for government development agenda, especially for monitoring the progress of National Strategic Development Plan and Royal Government Rectangular Strategy. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with the countryâ€™s specific economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poverty is a multidimensional concept: The concept of poverty is applied to situations at both individual (or household) and country levels. From both these perspectives, poverty is a multidimensional approach. At the country level poverty is linked to the capacity of the economy to provide a central administration with sufficient resources to develop infrastructures, organize public services and implement development programs. Key economic factors that determine this capacity include: the level of economic activity, the state of the international market, and the currently exchange rate. While the first of these three factors can be directly affected by policy at national level, the latter two are closely related to the global economic context. In addition, social factors are also key determinants of the capacity of the economy to provide adequate resources to the central administration.&lt;/p&gt;
