			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording error etc.,). None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weights for each survey observation are determined by the sampling design, design weights, and adjusted for non-response and other imperfections such as under coverage or, adjusted to improve the precision of estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
