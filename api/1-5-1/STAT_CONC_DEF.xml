			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;This indicator measures the number of people who died, went missing or were directly affected by disasters per 100,000 population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death: &lt;/strong&gt;The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing: &lt;/strong&gt;The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body, and for which an official/legal report has been filed with competent authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directly affected:  &lt;/strong&gt;The number of people who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are people who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time, due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructure, basic services, commerce or work, or social, health and psychological consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale and Interpretation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. Among the global targets, “Target A: Substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030, aiming to lower average per 100,000 global mortality between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015” and “Target B: Substantially reduce the number of affected people globally by 2030, aiming to lower the average global figure per 100,000 between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015” will contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience. The economic, environmental and social perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and climate change adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/51748&quot;&gt;report A/71/644&lt;/a&gt;). The relevant global indicators for the Sendai Framework will be used to report for this indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disaster loss data is greatly influenced by large-scale catastrophic events, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries report the data by event, so that complementary analysis can be undertaken to obtain trends and patterns in which such catastrophic events (that can represent outliers) can be included or excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
