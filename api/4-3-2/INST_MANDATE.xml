			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has robust and conducive policy and regulatory frameworks to ensure affordable access and connectivity. RGC, development partners, and private sector has continued to target infrastructure, essentially roads, rail, bridges, ports, hydropower, solar farms, power transmission lines and irrigation systems. This has, to some extent, enabled garment factories to be shifted from the capital to rural areas, making it closer to labour source and relieving some burdens on urban infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
