The survey provides a comprehensive set of indicators on living conditions in Cambodia, covering main socio-economic areas such as housing conditions, health, education, labor force, economic activities, victimization, vulnerability and others. The survey questionnaire was asked for the household and for the household members. The sample size was determined for annual CSES is about 3,600 households. Every 5 years it is conducted with a big sample size is about 12,000 households. The last four big sample surveys were conducted in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. However, this large sample survey has been conducted every two years started from 2021 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the CSES 2004, the diary method for collecting data on household expenditure/consumption and household income was introduced. As the recall method has been used in the previous rounds it was also decided to include in the recall modules. Thus, both methods are retained. The data collection was carried out throughout the whole calendar year, started from January to December. Face-to-face interview using the questionnaire was done and about 15 households per village were selected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website: http://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/home&lt;/p&gt;
