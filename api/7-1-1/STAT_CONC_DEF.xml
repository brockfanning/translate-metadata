			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Proportion of population with access to electricity is the percentage of population with access to electricity. This is expressed in percentage figures and is disaggregated by total, urban and rural area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to gain a clear picture, access rates are only considered if the primary source of lighting is the local electricity provider, solar systems, mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Sources such as generators, candles, batteries, etc. are not include due to their limited working capacities and since they are usually kept as backup sources for lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity access in this scenario refers to the proportion of population in the considered area (national, urban, rural, region or province) that has access to consistent sources of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
