			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The NIS decided to use statistical methods (calibration) to achieve better comparability between the different rounds of the CSES surveys by adjusting the samples to the population size and structure that was established by the national population census carried out in 2008. To mirror the rapid changes in the population, it proved necessary to project the population forwards to 2017 and backwards to 1993, taking into account fertility, mortality and internal migration rates.&lt;/p&gt;
