The gross value added generated by any unit engaged in production activity can be calculated as the residual of the units’ total output less intermediate consumption, goods and services used up in the process of producing the output, or as the sum of the factor incomes generated by the production process (System of National Accounts 2008). Manufacturing refers to industries belonging to the sector C defined by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, or D defined by ISIC Revision 3.</p>\n<p>GDP represents the sum of gross value added from all institutional units resident in the economy. For the purpose on comparability over time and across countries MVA and GDP are estimated in terms of constant prices in USD.

The share of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a country’s national development in general. MVA per capita is the basic indicator of a country’s level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of MVA per capita is classifying country groups according to the stage of industrial development.</p><p>Differences may appear due to different versions of System of National Accounts (SNA) or ISIC revisions used by countries.</p><p>MVA proportion to GDP = MVA/GDP*100.</p>\n<p>MVA per capita = MVA/population</p><p>Data availability by geographic location: national</p><p>National Accounts table:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nis.gov.kh/index.php/km/21-na/81-national-account-table\">http://nis.gov.kh/index.php/km/21-na/81-national-account-table</a></p>","km":""}}
