End poverty in all its forms everywhere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target 1.a: Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.a.2: Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document applies to the education component of indicator 1.a.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proportion of total government spending on education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proportion of total government spending on health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proportion of total government spending on social protection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proportion of total government spending on agriculture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.5.3, 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.a.1, 4.b.1, 4.b.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social Statistics Department, NIS, Ministry of Planning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kim Net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social Statistics Department, NIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director of Department&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;017 380 053/016 770 769&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. 386 Street 360, Sangkat Boeung Kengkang I, Khan Chamkarmon, Phnom Penh,​ Cambodia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;kimnettt@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers), expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure on all sectors (including health, education, social services, etc.). It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government expenditure on education covers educational expenditure by all levels of government (local, regional, central) on the formal education system, from early childhood to tertiary education, in both public and private instructional and non-instructional institutions within the borders of a country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenditure on education includes expenditure on core educational goods and services, such as teaching staff, school buildings, or school books and teaching materials, and peripheral educational goods and services such as ancillary services, general administration and other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Percent (%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual financial reports by Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MEYS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on total general government expenditure (all sectors) are obtained from the MEF financial database and are updated once a year. Whereas data on specific sectoral expenditure, such as education expenditure, health expenditure are provided by MEYS, MOH, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next round survey: 2021 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year after the reference period of the survey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute of Statistics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Working Group on Poverty Measurement, Ministry of Planning and Ministry of Economy and Finance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By virtue of the article 12 of Statistics Law, NIS in is responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collecting, processing, compiling, analyzing, publishing and disseminating basic data by conducting censuses and surveys, and utilizing administrative data sources;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compiling national accounts and price indexes, as well as economic, environment and socio-demographic indicators; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coordination with line ministries as data producers as mandated by the Statistics Law; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Functioning as the central repository of SDG indicators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The indicator is used to assess a government&apos;s emphasis on education relative to its investments in other sectors. The indicator shows how much of a priority education is for a given government, over time or in comparison with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some instances data on total public expenditure on education refer only to the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, excluding other ministries may also spend a part of their budget on educational activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total government expenditure for a given level of education (e.g. primary, secondary, or all levels combined) is expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure (all sectors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; = total government expenditure in financial year &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of this indicator provides child-based estimates of monetary poverty based on the World Bank poverty analysis in the 2009 Cambodian Social and Economic Survey. We show how overall population poverty compares to child poverty (for those aged 17 and under) and then give a range of poverty profiles for poor children. In addition, we show the overlapping populations of children according to monetary poverty and deprivation status – as shown in the UNICEF Cambodia 2012 profile of child poverty using deprivation measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our profiling has been undertaken with Situational Analysis in mind, and we have additionally shown a descriptive multi-variate regression of child poverty risk that shows the correlations between a range of geographic, household and economic factors that can inform discussions of the determinants of child well-being and especially on ‘financial barriers’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more in-depth analysis of the relationship between monetary poverty and child deprivation is contained in an accompanying paper, which is more exploratory in nature in order to examine the relationship between deprivation and consumption levels below, at and above the poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIS decided to use statistical methods (calibration) to achieve better comparability between the different rounds of the CSES surveys by adjusting the samples to the population size and structure that was established by the national population census carried out in 2008. To mirror the rapid changes in the population, it proved necessary to project the population forwards to 2017 and backwards to 1993, taking into account fertility, mortality and internal migration rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the data has been input by poverty economists, which has been checked carefully together with the metadata information by the central team for monitoring SDGs 1.2.2 in the World Bank. Then data has been sent to the UNDP and UNICEF for further verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By level of education, national and sub-national (provincial level)&lt;/p&gt;
