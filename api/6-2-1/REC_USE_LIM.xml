			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Comparisons of the results from the 2007 CSES with previous surveys in 1993/94, 1996, 1997 and 1999, are not recommended due to differences in the survey design. Fieldwork from the last five surveys (2004, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010) covered 15 months, and results can be reported for both 12 month (calendar year) and 15 month periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weights used in the reports from CSES 2004, are adjusted by using the preliminary population projections which give over estimated population counts. The weights in CSES 2007 are adjusted by using the preliminary result from 2008 Population Census. Some provinces were excluded, due to cost and other reasons, in the sample for 2007. The estimates are however, adjusted for the under coverage error caused by excluding those provinces. A recalculation of the weights in CSES 2004 has been made for the coming analyses to obtain higher comparability between CSES 2004, and the surveys conducted from 2007 and onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is import to note that the data for from previous surveys until CSES 2017 to lack of resource and technical limited, data on water quality treatment for faecal and chemical contamination through this survey are not collected.&lt;/p&gt;
