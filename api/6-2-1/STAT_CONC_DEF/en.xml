	<data>&lt;p&gt;The proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water is currently being measured by the proportion of the population using a basic sanitation facility which is not shared with other households and where excreta is safely disposed in situ or treated off-site. ‘Improved’ sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population with a basic hand washing facility: a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate hand washing with soap and water in the household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The above-mentioned definition, however Cambodia applies only the proportion of population using improved sanitation facilities. ‘Improved’ sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. &lt;/p&gt;</data>
