			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;Number of the anemic women aged 15-49 years divided by number of the total women aged 15-49 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. In surveys, blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer in the field that uses the azide-methaemoglobin method.&lt;/p&gt;
