			<language lang="en">&lt;p&gt;The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) estimates access to basic services for Cambodia by fitting a regression line to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses, for example CSES, CDHS, CIPS and GPCC. This approach the WHO/UNICEF JMP was used to report on use of ‘improved water’ sources for SDG monitoring, whereas Cambodia used only data from CSES.&lt;/p&gt;
