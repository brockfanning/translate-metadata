	<data>&lt;p&gt;Under-five mortality is the probability of dying before the fifth birthday in the five or ten years preceding the survey, per 1,000 live births.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The under-five mortality rate as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time), but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births.&lt;/p&gt;</data>
